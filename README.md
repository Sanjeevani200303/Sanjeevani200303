> _“Between logic and lyricism, I build — and I feel.”_

Hey there 👋  
I’m **Sanjeevani**, a developer, thinker, and lover of all things intricate — whether it’s a line of code, a brushstroke of art, or the curve of a tragic narrative.  
I believe creativity isn’t a separate world from technology — it’s what gives it soul.

## 🧠 What I Do  

💻 **Developer at heart** — exploring the harmony between systems and stories.  
🌐 Currently working on:
- **Computer Vision & Deep Learning** — building intelligent systems with YOLOv8.  
- **Data Analysis** — learning how to make data tell its own story, beautifully.  
- **Java & DSA** — strengthening core logic to sculpt efficient, elegant solutions.  

✨ I love creating things that blend **precision** with **emotion** — like machines that *see*, systems that *learn*, and designs that *speak*.

## 🪞 A Little About Me  

🎨 A lover of **fashion**, **psychological thrillers**, **romance**, and **tragedy** — the genres that remind me that creation and emotion are inseparable.  
📚 Fascinated by **sociology**, **theology**, and **psychology**, I often find myself tracing how humans think, feel, and believe.  
💭 My favorite kind of work? Anything that demands **intellect, intuition, and a little heartbreak** — the perfect recipe for art or code.

## 🌷 Beyond the Code  

When I’m not coding, I’m usually:  
- sketching aesthetics and stories from everyday life 🖋️  
- exploring philosophy & art  
- or curating playlists that sound like rainy evenings and distant dreams ☁️
